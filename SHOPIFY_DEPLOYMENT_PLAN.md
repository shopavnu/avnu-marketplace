# Shopify-First Migration Deployment Plan

## 1. Pre-Deployment Verification

We've completed the following tasks to prepare for deployment:

- ✅ Removed WooCommerce dependencies from the codebase
- ✅ Updated our platform integration to focus exclusively on Shopify
- ✅ Created a database migration script to handle the data transformation
- ✅ Updated the frontend components to reflect Shopify-first approach
- ✅ Created necessary documentation for merchants
- ✅ Fixed type errors and test files to align with our Shopify-first approach

## 2. Deployment Process

### 2.1. Database Migration

1. Run the Shopify-first migration on the production database:
   ```bash
   npm run migration:run
   ```

   This will:
   - Back up existing WooCommerce connections
   - Update product metadata to reflect Shopify as the integration type
   - Update platform types in relevant tables

### 2.2. Backend Deployment

1. Build the production backend:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy the backend following your standard deployment process
   - Ensure Shopify environment variables are properly set in the production environment
   - Verify the `.env.production` file contains all required Shopify API credentials

### 2.3. Frontend Deployment

1. Build the production frontend:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend && npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy the frontend following your standard deployment process

## 3. Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify the following:

1. **Merchant Experience**:
   - Ensure merchants can connect their Shopify stores
   - Verify product synchronization works correctly
   - Test order synchronization functionality

2. **Admin Features**:
   - Confirm Shopify store management in the admin panel works
   - Verify analytics and reporting for Shopify stores

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Verify webhook validation works correctly
   - Check error handling and logging for Shopify API interactions

## 4. Rollback Plan

If critical issues are discovered post-deployment:

1. **Database Rollback**:
   The migration script includes a `down()` method that can be executed to restore WooCommerce connections:
   ```bash
   npm run migration:revert
   ```

2. **Code Rollback**:
   If necessary, revert to the previous version of the codebase

## 5. Follow-up Tasks

1. Monitor error logs and system performance for the first 48 hours after deployment
2. Collect feedback from merchants about the Shopify integration
3. Update documentation as needed based on merchant questions and feedback
4. Schedule a review meeting 1 week post-deployment to address any outstanding issues
