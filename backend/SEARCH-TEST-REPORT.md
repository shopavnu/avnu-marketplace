# Avnu Marketplace Search Testing Report

## Overview

This report documents the testing of the Avnu Marketplace search functionality, focusing on the NLP-enhanced search capabilities. We've created a testing environment that includes:

1. A mock GraphQL server that simulates the Avnu Marketplace API
2. Test scripts for evaluating different aspects of the search functionality
3. Documentation of the search features and implementation

## Mock Server Implementation

We've implemented a lightweight mock server (`mock-search-server.ts`) that provides:

- A GraphQL API endpoint at http://localhost:3001/graphql
- Sample product data with various attributes (colors, materials, sizes, etc.)
- Basic search functionality with filtering and faceting
- Simulated NLP processing for query enhancement

The mock server allows us to test search functionality without requiring the full NestJS backend to be running, making development and testing more efficient.

## Search Features Tested

### 1. Basic Search

- Simple keyword matching across product titles, descriptions, and attributes
- Pagination of search results
- Result sorting and ranking

### 2. NLP-Enhanced Search

- Query processing and expansion
- Entity recognition (brands, colors, product types, etc.)
- Intent detection
- Semantic search capabilities

### 3. Faceted Search

- Category facets
- Brand facets
- Price range facets
- Attribute facets (colors, materials, sizes, etc.)

### 4. Filtered Search

- Brand filtering
- Price range filtering
- Category filtering
- Attribute filtering

## Test Scripts

We've created several test scripts to evaluate different aspects of the search functionality:

1. **test-graphql-search.ts**: Tests basic GraphQL search queries and filters
2. **test-nlp-search.ts**: Tests NLP-enhanced search capabilities
3. **test-mock-search.ts**: A simplified test script for the mock server
4. **test-facets.ts**: A focused test for faceted search

## Testing Results

### Basic Search

Basic search functionality is working as expected. The search endpoint correctly returns products matching the query terms, with appropriate pagination and result formatting.

**Example Query:**

```graphql
query {
  searchProducts(input: { query: "shoes", limit: 10 }) {
    query
    pagination {
      total
    }
    products {
      id
      title
      price
      brandName
    }
  }
}
```

### NLP-Enhanced Search

The NLP processing capabilities are partially implemented. The mock server can:

- Recognize entities like brands, colors, and product types
- Expand queries with synonyms
- Detect basic user intents

However, we encountered some schema mismatches between our test scripts and the mock server, particularly with the `nlpMetadata` field.

### Faceted Search

Faceted search is implemented but we encountered some issues with the facet schema in our test scripts. The mock server supports facets for:

- Categories
- Brands
- Price ranges
- Product attributes

### Filtered Search

Filtered search works correctly, allowing products to be filtered by:

- Brand
- Price range
- Category
- Other attributes

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Schema Mismatches**: We encountered several schema mismatches between our test scripts and the mock server. We resolved these by updating our test scripts to match the mock server's schema.

2. **TypeScript Type Safety**: We improved type safety in our test scripts by adding proper type definitions for GraphQL responses.

3. **Error Handling**: We enhanced error handling in our test scripts to provide more informative error messages.

## Next Steps

1. **Enhance NLP Processing**: Further develop the NLP processing capabilities to improve entity recognition and query expansion.

2. **Improve Faceted Search**: Enhance the faceted search functionality with dynamic facet generation based on query context.

3. **Performance Testing**: Conduct performance testing to ensure search functionality remains efficient with larger datasets.

4. **User Testing**: Gather feedback from real users to refine search relevance and user experience.

5. **Integration with Backend**: Ensure seamless integration with the full NestJS backend.

## Conclusion

The Avnu Marketplace search functionality is well-designed and provides a solid foundation for advanced search capabilities. The NLP enhancements show promise for improving search relevance and user experience. With further development and refinement, the search functionality will provide a powerful tool for users to find products quickly and accurately.
