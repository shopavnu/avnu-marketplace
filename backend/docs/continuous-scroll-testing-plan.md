# Continuous Scroll Testing Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive testing plan for the continuous scroll implementation in the Avnu Marketplace, focusing on product card consistency and smooth scrolling experience.

## 1. Setup Requirements

- **Environments**: Test on development, staging, and production environments
- **Devices**: Desktop (various screen sizes), mobile devices, and tablets
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Network Conditions**: Test under various network speeds (fast, medium, slow)
- **Data**: Ensure a mix of products with different image sizes, descriptions, and prices

## 2. Backend Testing

### 2.1 Cursor-Based Pagination

- [ ] Verify cursor encoding/decoding works correctly
- [ ] Ensure pagination is stable (same products don't appear twice)
- [ ] Check that pagination metadata (nextCursor, hasMore) is correct
- [ ] Test with various page sizes (limit parameter)
- [ ] Verify total count calculation when withCount=true

### 2.2 Batch Sections Loading

- [ ] Test loading multiple sections in parallel
- [ ] Test loading multiple sections sequentially
- [ ] Verify section-specific filtering works correctly
- [ ] Check performance with many sections (5+)
- [ ] Ensure consistent product card data across sections

### 2.3 Progressive Loading

- [ ] Test HIGH priority loading (visible content)
- [ ] Test MEDIUM priority loading (near-viewport content)
- [ ] Test LOW priority loading (off-screen content)
- [ ] Verify PREFETCH works for background loading
- [ ] Test loading with exclusions to avoid duplicates
- [ ] Check performance under heavy load

### 2.4 Image Processing & Validation

- [ ] Verify images are processed to consistent dimensions (800x800)
- [ ] Check that aspect ratio is preserved during processing
- [ ] Test with various image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- [ ] Verify placeholder images for products with missing images
- [ ] Test with extremely large and small original images

### 2.5 Data Normalization

- [ ] Verify product data is normalized consistently
- [ ] Check virtual fields (isOnSale, discountPercentage)
- [ ] Test with products from different merchants/sources
- [ ] Verify text sanitization for descriptions

## 3. Frontend Testing

### 3.1 Scroll Performance

- [ ] Measure and verify smooth scrolling (60fps target)
- [ ] Check for layout shifts during scrolling (should be none)
- [ ] Test rapid scrolling behavior
- [ ] Verify scroll position is maintained during data loading
- [ ] Test scroll restoration after page refresh

### 3.2 Product Card Consistency

- [ ] Verify all product cards have the same height (360px)
- [ ] Check that images maintain consistent dimensions
- [ ] Test with various product title lengths
- [ ] Test with various product description lengths
- [ ] Verify price formatting is consistent

### 3.3 Loading States

- [ ] Check loading indicators during initial load
- [ ] Verify loading indicators during "load more"
- [ ] Test skeleton screens for unloaded content
- [ ] Verify graceful handling of loading errors
- [ ] Test loading cancellation when scrolling quickly

### 3.4 Responsiveness

- [ ] Test grid layout on various screen sizes
- [ ] Verify mobile-specific optimizations
- [ ] Check tablet-specific layouts
- [ ] Test orientation changes (portrait/landscape)
- [ ] Verify consistent card heights across all devices

## 4. Edge Cases

- [ ] Test with empty sections/results
- [ ] Verify behavior with network interruptions
- [ ] Test with extremely slow connections
- [ ] Check behavior when scrolling to the very end of results
- [ ] Verify handling of invalid cursor values
- [ ] Test with malformed product data
- [ ] Check behavior with missing images or broken image URLs
- [ ] Test with extremely long product titles and descriptions

## 5. Performance Metrics

- [ ] Time to first meaningful paint
- [ ] Time to interactive
- [ ] Scroll jank measurement (layout shifts)
- [ ] Memory usage during extended scrolling
- [ ] CPU usage during scrolling
- [ ] Network requests per scroll segment
- [ ] Cache hit rate for prefetched content

## 6. Accessibility Testing

- [ ] Keyboard navigation through product grid
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Focus management during continuous loading
- [ ] Color contrast for product cards
- [ ] Text resizing behavior

## 7. User Experience Testing

- [ ] Perceived smoothness of scrolling
- [ ] Consistency of visual experience
- [ ] Intuitiveness of loading more content
- [ ] Comparison with competitor implementations
- [ ] Overall satisfaction with scrolling experience

## 8. Regression Testing

- [ ] Verify fixes for previous layout shift issues
- [ ] Check that card heights remain consistent after updates
- [ ] Ensure scroll performance doesn't degrade over time
- [ ] Verify image processing continues to work correctly
- [ ] Check that data normalization remains consistent

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Continuous Scroll

1. Load the discovery feed
2. Scroll down slowly to trigger progressive loading
3. Continue scrolling to load at least 5 pages of content
4. Verify no layout shifts occur during scrolling
5. Check that all product cards maintain the same height

### Scenario 2: Rapid Scrolling

1. Load the discovery feed
2. Scroll rapidly to the bottom of the current content
3. Verify loading indicators appear appropriately
4. Check that new content loads and maintains consistent card heights
5. Verify no layout shifts during rapid content loading

### Scenario 3: Section Navigation

1. Load the homepage with multiple product sections
2. Scroll through different sections (Featured, New Arrivals, etc.)
3. Verify each section loads correctly with consistent card heights
4. Check that scrolling between sections is smooth
5. Verify section-specific filtering works correctly

### Scenario 4: Network Resilience

1. Load the discovery feed
2. Enable network throttling in browser dev tools
3. Scroll to trigger more content loading
4. Verify graceful loading states during slow network
5. Temporarily disable network and verify error handling
6. Re-enable network and check recovery behavior

### Scenario 5: Device Rotation

1. Load the discovery feed on a mobile device
2. Scroll to load several pages of content
3. Rotate device from portrait to landscape
4. Verify layout adjusts appropriately without losing scroll position
5. Check that all product cards maintain consistent heights in new orientation
6. Continue scrolling in new orientation to verify continued loading

## Reporting

Document any issues found during testing with:
- Clear steps to reproduce
- Environment details (browser, device, network conditions)
- Screenshots or videos demonstrating the issue
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Impact assessment (critical, major, minor)

## Success Criteria

The continuous scroll implementation will be considered successful when:
1. No layout shifts occur during scrolling
2. All product cards maintain consistent heights (360px)
3. Scrolling performance maintains 60fps on modern devices
4. Content loads progressively without interrupting the user experience
5. The implementation works consistently across all supported browsers and devices
