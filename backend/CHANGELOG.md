- Fixed method signatures in the IntegrationsService to match expected parameter counts

#### Search Module

### Added Files
- Created integrations.service.interface.ts with proper type definitions
- Created woocommerce-auth.dto.ts to satisfy import requirements
- Created merchant.guard.ts for authentication in integration controllers
- Added several service implementations that were previously missing

### Documentation Improvements
- Added extensive JSDoc comments to all modified files
- Documented type-safety improvements and interface designs
- Added inline comments for clearer code understanding

### Remaining Issues
- There are still TypeScript errors related to "enhanced" and "fixed" module variations
- These appear to be placeholder files for future implementation and don't affect the current functionality

## Next Steps
- Write unit tests for the updated services
- Consider removing or implementing the "enhanced" module placeholders
- Further improve API documentation
