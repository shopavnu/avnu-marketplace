# Pull Request: Product Card Optimization, Personalization, and Data Quality Improvements

## Overview
This PR addresses several critical improvements for the Avnu Marketplace platform:
1. **Vertical Optimization**: Restoration and enhancement of product cards with consistent heights across all device sizes
2. **Personalization System**: Implementation of robust recommendation components with consistent UI
3. **Data Quality**: Product validation, suppression, and merchant notification system
4. **Code Quality**: Comprehensive linting and TypeScript fixes across the codebase

## Changes Made

### 1. Linting Fixes
- **Backend (NestJS/TypeScript)**:
  - Fixed unused imports in controllers and services
  - Prefixed unused variables with underscores in test files
  - Corrected import/export issues in ES modules
  - Fixed duplicate variable declarations in data-normalization.service.ts
  - Updated test files to match actual service return types

- **Frontend (React/TypeScript)**:
  - Fixed module import issues
  - Added proper type definitions
  - Created utility functions for formatting

### 2. TypeScript Improvements
- **Backend**:
  - Created separate `tsconfig.scripts.json` for example scripts with JSX support
  - Fixed type errors in merchant-analytics.spec.ts
  - Added type declarations for external modules used in example scripts:
    - @apollo/client
    - chart.js
    - react-chartjs-2

- **Frontend**:
  - Updated `tsconfig.json` with:
    - Changed target from ES5 to ES6
    - Changed moduleResolution from "bundler" to "node"
    - Updated JSX setting to "react-jsx"
    - Added wildcard path mapping for better module resolution

### 3. Vertical Optimization for Product Cards
- **Backend Image Processing**:
  - Generates device-specific images:
    - Mobile: 400x400
    - Tablet: 600x600
    - Desktop: 800x800
  - Returns a `ProcessedImage` object with URLs for each size

- **Frontend Components**:
  - Restored and enhanced responsive product cards with consistent vertical alignment
  - Implemented fixed card dimensions for mobile, tablet, and desktop views
  - Added robust image fallback handling with placeholders
  - Created text truncation for titles and descriptions with fixed heights
  - Added support for badges (sale, featured, out-of-stock)
  - Created matching skeleton loaders to prevent layout shifts

### 4. Personalization & Recommendation System
- **Backend Services**:
  - Implemented recommendation service for personalized product suggestions
  - Created similar product calculation based on attributes and view patterns
  - Added trending product identification
  - Developed user preference tracking

- **Frontend Components**:
  - Created modular recommendation components:
    - PersonalizedRecommendations
    - SimilarProducts
    - RecentlyViewedProducts
  - Implemented impression and click tracking for analytics
  - Added robust loading, error, and empty states

### 5. Product Suppression & Merchant Notification
- **Backend Services**:
  - Created ProductValidationService to validate product data completeness
  - Implemented context-aware suppression for products with missing key data
  - Developed NotificationService for merchant email alerts
  - Added scheduled validation tasks (daily full validation, hourly for new imports)

- **Frontend Integration**:
  - Updated product cards to show suppression status to merchants
  - Modified recommendation components to filter out suppressed products
  - Added merchant-specific views with guidance on fixing issues
  - Implemented automatic fetching of additional products to maintain requested counts

## Testing
- All linting errors and warnings have been resolved
- TypeScript compilation passes with no errors on the frontend
- Backend core application passes TypeScript checks
- Responsive product cards maintain consistent heights across device sizes
- Recommendation components correctly filter out suppressed products
- Product validation correctly identifies missing key data
- Email notifications are properly formatted and include all necessary information

## Next Steps
- Consider addressing remaining TypeScript errors in example script files
- Implement automated tests for responsive image generation
- Add performance monitoring for image optimization
- Create a merchant dashboard for viewing and managing suppressed products
- Implement analytics for tracking suppression rates and resolution times
