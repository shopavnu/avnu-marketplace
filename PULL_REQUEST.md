# Pull Request: Code Quality and Responsive Design Improvements

## Overview
This PR addresses two major areas of improvement for the Avnu Marketplace platform:
1. **Code Quality**: Comprehensive linting and TypeScript fixes across the entire codebase
2. **Responsive Design**: Restoration and enhancement of responsive product cards with consistent heights

## Changes Made

### 1. Linting Fixes
- **Backend (NestJS/TypeScript)**:
  - Fixed unused imports in controllers and services
  - Prefixed unused variables with underscores in test files
  - Corrected import/export issues in ES modules
  - Fixed duplicate variable declarations in data-normalization.service.ts
  - Updated test files to match actual service return types

- **Frontend (React/TypeScript)**:
  - Fixed module import issues
  - Added proper type definitions
  - Created utility functions for formatting

### 2. TypeScript Improvements
- **Backend**:
  - Created separate `tsconfig.scripts.json` for example scripts with JSX support
  - Fixed type errors in merchant-analytics.spec.ts
  - Added type declarations for external modules used in example scripts:
    - @apollo/client
    - chart.js
    - react-chartjs-2

- **Frontend**:
  - Updated `tsconfig.json` with:
    - Changed target from ES5 to ES6
    - Changed moduleResolution from "bundler" to "node"
    - Updated JSX setting to "react-jsx"
    - Added wildcard path mapping for better module resolution

### 3. Responsive Product Cards
- **Backend Image Processing**:
  - Generates device-specific images:
    - Mobile: 400x400
    - Tablet: 600x600
    - Desktop: 800x800
  - Returns a `ProcessedImage` object with URLs for each size

- **Frontend Components**:
  - Restored and enhanced responsive product cards
  - Implemented device detection with useEffect
  - Added responsive text truncation
  - Ensured consistent card heights across all device sizes
  - Fixed SSR compatibility issues

## Testing
- All linting errors and warnings have been resolved
- TypeScript compilation passes with no errors on the frontend
- Backend core application passes TypeScript checks
- Responsive product cards maintain consistent heights across device sizes

## Next Steps
- Consider addressing remaining TypeScript errors in example script files
- Implement automated tests for responsive image generation
- Add performance monitoring for image optimization
