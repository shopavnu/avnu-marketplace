## Major Changes Implemented

### 1. Homepage UI/UX Enhancements
- **Brands You Might Like:**
  - Replaced static "Featured Brands" with a dynamic, shuffled set for freshness.
- **Popular Now:**
  - Added a new section showing top-rated/trending products, now using compact `ProductCard` components.
- **For You:**
  - Main discovery feed, now comes after the above two sections.

### 2. Strict Typing & Lint Fixes
- Added TypeScript generics and strict types to all utility functions.
- Adapted static/mock data to match the full `Product` type expected by all UI components.
- Fixed all outstanding lint/type errors, especially around product ratings and data adaptation.

### 3. Personalization Planning
- Created `docs/personalization-plan.md`:
  - Outlines a step-by-step approach to user-based personalization (auth, data model, SSR/CSR fetching, analytics).
  - Includes example pseudocode, references, and a checklist for future implementation.

### 4. Miscellaneous
- Searched for and planned the removal of the mock API status window (pending direct identification in codebase).

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/pages/index.tsx`: All homepage UI/logic changes, type fixes, and section upgrades.
- `docs/personalization-plan.md`: Central documentation for future personalization work.

---

## Next Steps
- Remove the mock API status window once its source is found in the codebase.
- Begin implementing user authentication and server-side personalization logic as outlined in the plan.
- Continue to monitor for and address any UI/UX or type issues as the codebase evolves.
