# Avnu Marketplace Shopify Integration

## Project Overview

This documentation set provides comprehensive implementation details, best practices, and architecture patterns for integrating the Avnu Marketplace with Shopify using the 2025-01 API version. The goal is a robust, scalable system that efficiently handles product synchronization, order processing, and fulfillment.

## Project Phases Complete

### Phase 1: Interface Design
- Created standardized interfaces in the common module to define service contracts
- Established consistent error handling patterns
- Defined shared data models and types

### Phase 2: Core Implementation  
- Implemented ShopifyClientService for GraphQL and REST API communication
- Created enhanced authentication services with secure token storage
- Developed webhook handling with proper signature validation

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
- Implemented ShopifyFulfillmentService with support for multiple concurrent fulfillment holds
- Created ShopifyBulkOperationService for efficient large dataset handling
- Fixed type safety issues and enhanced error handling

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing
- Consolidated module structure to eliminate circular dependencies
- Created comprehensive unit tests for all enhanced services
- Implemented integration tests for the Shopify integration
- Documented best practices and implementation patterns

## Key Components

### Services

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| ShopifyClientService | Core service for API communication using both GraphQL and REST |
| ShopifyAuthService | Handles OAuth authentication and secure token storage |
| ShopifyWebhookService | Manages webhook registration, validation, and processing |
| ShopifyProductService | Handles product creation, updates, and synchronization |
| ShopifyBulkOperationService | Manages asynchronous bulk operations for large datasets |
| ShopifyFulfillmentService | Provides enhanced fulfillment capabilities including multiple holds |

### Enhanced Features

- **Multiple Fulfillment Holds**: Create and manage multiple concurrent holds on orders
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficiently process large datasets using Shopify's Bulk Operations API
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Consistent error processing across all services
- **Type Safety**: Properly typed interfaces and implementations
- **Secure Token Storage**: Encrypted storage of access tokens

## Getting Started

To start using the Shopify integration, follow these steps:

1. **Import the Module**:
   ```typescript
   import { ShopifyAppModule } from './modules/integrations/shopify-app/shopify-app.module';
   ```

2. **Inject Services using Interface Tokens**:
   ```typescript
   @Injectable()
   export class YourService {
     constructor(
       @Inject(SHOPIFY_CONSTANTS.INJECTION_TOKENS.SHOPIFY_FULFILLMENT_SERVICE)
       private readonly fulfillmentService: IShopifyFulfillmentService,
     ) {}
   }
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   ```
   SHOPIFY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   SHOPIFY_API_VERSION=2025-01
   SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
   SHOPIFY_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY=32-character-encryption-key
   ```

4. **Run the Tests**:
   ```bash
   # Run unit tests
   npm run test -- --testPathPattern=shopify
   
   # Run integration tests
   npm run test:e2e -- --testPathPattern=shopify-integration
   ```

## Testing with Real Shopify Data

For testing with a real Shopify development store:

1. Create a [Shopify Partners](https://www.shopify.com/partners) account
2. Set up a development store
3. Create a custom app with the necessary API scopes
4. Configure the test environment as described in [Test Environment Setup](./development/test-environment.md)

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Use Interface Tokens**: Always inject services using interface tokens to avoid circular dependencies
2. **Handle Errors Consistently**: Process and transform GraphQL errors into meaningful application errors
3. **Respect Rate Limits**: Implement proper rate limiting to avoid API throttling
4. **Use Bulk Operations**: For large datasets, use bulk operations instead of pagination
5. **Secure Sensitive Data**: Encrypt access tokens and other sensitive information
6. **Validate Webhooks**: Always validate webhook signatures before processing
7. **Implement Idempotency**: Ensure operations can be safely retried
8. **Test Thoroughly**: Create comprehensive unit and integration tests

## Next Steps and Future Improvements

1. **Metrics and Monitoring**: Add observability for API usage and performance
2. **Enhanced Caching**: Implement more sophisticated caching strategies
3. **Webhook Processing Queue**: Add a queue system for webhook processing
4. **Expanded Bulk Operations**: Cover additional entity types with bulk operations
5. **Multi-shop Support**: Enhance concurrent support for multiple shops
6. **Rate Limit Backoff**: Implement adaptive rate limit handling
