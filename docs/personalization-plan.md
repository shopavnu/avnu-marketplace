# Avnu Marketplace Personalization Plan

## Objective
Enable user-based personalization on the Avnu Marketplace homepage and throughout the app, providing dynamic recommendations and experiences tailored to each user’s interests, behaviors, and profile data.

---

## 1. Personalization Data Sources
- **User Profile:**
  - Interests, favorite categories, brands, past purchases, wishlists, demographics.
- **User Behavior:**
  - Recent searches, clicks, product/brand views, cart activity.
- **External Data:**
  - Shopify/Shop app data, previous orders, external recommendation APIs.

---

## 2. Technical Approach
### A. Authentication & User Context
- Integrate authentication (OAuth, Shopify, or custom) to identify users.
- Store user session in cookies or JWT for SSR/CSR compatibility.
- Fetch user profile and preferences server-side (getServerSideProps) or client-side (React Context/API hooks).

### B. Data Fetching & State Management
- Use Next.js data fetching (getServerSideProps or API routes) to get personalized data on page load.
- Store personalization data in global state (React Context, Redux, or SWR/React Query cache).
- Fallback to anonymous/session-based personalization if user is not logged in.

### C. Recommendation Logic
- Brands You Might Like: Recommend brands based on user’s interests, recent engagement, or similar users.
- Popular Now: Show trending products in categories or brands the user likes.
- For You: Curate feed based on user profile, purchase history, and browsing behavior.

## 3. Implementation Steps
1. **Add Authentication:**
   - Implement login (Shopify, email, etc.) and persist user session.
2. **User Data Model:**
   - Define and store user profile, preferences, and interaction history.
3. **Personalized Fetching:**
   - Use user ID/session to fetch personalized recommendations server-side.
   - Update homepage sections to use personalized data if available.
4. **Fallbacks:**
   - If user is not logged in, use session/localStorage or show generic recommendations.
5. **Analytics:**
   - Track user events to improve future recommendations.

## 4. Example Pseudocode
```typescript
// In getServerSideProps (Next.js)
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const user = await getUserFromSession(context.req);
  let personalizedBrands = [];
  let personalizedProducts = [];
  if (user) {
    personalizedBrands = await fetchUserRecommendedBrands(user.id);
    personalizedProducts = await fetchUserRecommendedProducts(user.id);
  }
  return {
    props: {
      personalizedBrands,
      personalizedProducts,
      user: user || null,
    },
  };
}
```

---

## 5. Future Enhancements
- Integrate ML-based recommendation engine.
- Real-time updates based on live user behavior.
- Cross-device/session personalization.
- Privacy controls for users to manage their data.
